# Hosting Dashboard

This repository is organized into two main folders:

- `backend` – the NestJS API and related configuration.
- `frontend` – the future dashboard UI (empty for now).

The backend folder still contains all previous project files. Move into that directory to run the API as before:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

Add your frontend implementation inside the `frontend` folder when you're ready.

# Hosting Dashboard

This repository is organized into two main folders:

- `backend` – the NestJS API and related configuration.
- `frontend` – the future dashboard UI (empty for now).

The backend folder still contains all previous project files. Copy the provided example environment file to `.env`, adjust the values if needed, and move into that directory to run the API:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

Add your frontend implementation inside the `frontend` folder when you're ready.
